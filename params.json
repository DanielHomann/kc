{"name":"KeyCheck","tagline":"Test your cryptographic keys","body":"All cryptographic keys in your organization are chosen with the utmost care! OpenSSL always creates secure keys! Broken random number generators are never deployed! Really? How could you know for sure? \r\n\r\nYour organization deploys many keys every year? Due to ignorance or software bugs some of them might be chosen badly and therefore compromise the encryption and authenticity of your electronic communication.\r\n \r\nKeyCheck offers a solution to this problem by detecting weak keys ahead of their deployment. KeyCheck tests uploaded keys for several known weaknesses (common gcds, Debian weak key, nearly equal or small prime factors) and reports the result via an optional web-interface. The flexibility and easy expandability allow adapting easily to upcoming vulnerabilities by adding new tests or new clients to the web service. \r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n* relational database (only MySQL tested)\r\n* python with standard library (tested version 2.7, version 3.x probably not running, the same holds for version 2.x with x < 7)\r\n* OpenSSL and openssl-vulnkey\r\n* SQLalchemy\r\n* Flask\r\n* gmpy\r\n* database driver (the SQLalchemy error message will tell you the name of the required driver) for python\r\n\r\n\r\nClone this repo for using KeyCheck\r\nBefore starting KeyCheck open config.cfg and enter the correct database connection information in the section [db]\r\nThe possible values for Type are described here: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/core/engines.html\r\nHost, User, Password should be self-explaining.\r\n\r\nstart keycheck from the directory kc with bin/keycheck.py \r\nThe option -h displays a help-page\r\nWith the option --reset the initial database structure is created, all other data in the database is deleted\r\n\r\nExamples of use:\r\npython bin/keycheck.py -c all -k 1 -f test-data/debian-weak/1\r\nTests a sample key as user \"all\" with key reference 1 \r\n\r\npython bin/keycheck.py -c all -r 1\r\nReturns the result of test run 1 (watch out: test run is not the same as the key reference)\r\n\r\npython bin/keycheck.py -b -s -f test-data/debian-weak/\r\nBatch import the whole directory. Names of files has to be numbers. -s specifes silent input\r\n\r\npython bin/keycheck.py -g -c global\r\nExecute global tests as user global\r\n\r\npython web.py\r\nStarts the webserver.

An initial working config is created by --reset The relevant tables are: Client, Test_Set and Test\r\nThe client table contains the clients, their test set (each client has an unique test set) and the flag \"admin\" which decides whether the user has the right to see the revoked keys of other users\r\nThe table contains the ids and descriptions of the existing Test_Set.\r\nThe table Test says which test should be executed with which parameters in which tests set. The type describes, weather the test should be executed synchron (0), asynchron (1) or is a global test (2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
